  cnc_robot_equipment_1_short:0 "CnC-Bot"
  cnc_robot_equipment_1_desc:0 "This model is rough around the edges and completely lacks finesse. However what it lacks in refinement it makes up for in autonomy. This numerically controlled robot is the definition of function over form as it steamrolls over any problem exactly as ordered. Its outer hull is made entirely out of stamped steel that had little to improvements done to its exterior with a shoddy paint job. Its arms are outfitted with basic servos that can carry a variety of attachments, most commonly they carry a mechanized claw and a basic micro fusion laser system."

It’s now outfitted with a large range of improvements that elevate its performance to match its top of the line competitors. Improved thrusters, wider range and further armor piercing capabilities make it a menace on the battlefield. Its outer shell now includes a titanium alloy that renders it even more rigid against all forms of damage."

  support_robot_two_legs_equipment_2_short:0 "Protectron Mk2"
  support_robot_two_legs_equipment_2_desc:0 "Mark 2 Protectrons are a line of advanced robots manufactured by RobCo for light police duty. While \"advanced\" is a relative term when it comes to Protectrons, the addition of energy machineguns replacing their old cumbersome laser pistols makes them fearsome opponents. The final touch is a series of bolted-on plating to supplement the bullet-proof shell."

  super_heavy_robot_equipment_2_desc:0 "A gargantuan beast of a machine, calling this robot a walking tank would be a disservice to the sheer bulk in weaponry and armour it carries. Originally armed with four fast-firing .50 cal machineguns, those were replaced for a quadruple 20mm autocannon arrangement. Combined with armour thick enough to stop plasma projectiles or even naval artillery, there is nothing our enemy can do but gasp before being shred to pieces."
