#-------------------------------
  robot_production_efficiency_1_tech: "Dedicated Mechanics"
  robot_production_efficiency_1_tech_desc: "While our mechanized units are aced their initial examination in the field, their sheer complexity heavily limits us to utilize them in a wider sense. If we truly want to use them as our frontline units, we'll have to organize designated personnel for their maintenance and assembly. This, however, will heavily tie up our accessible human resources."
  robot_production_efficiency_2_tech: "Improved Manufacturing"
  robot_production_efficiency_2_tech_desc: "As we become more and more dependent on our robotic allies the more they drain our available resources. Further funding will be relocated for developing our manufacturing process, and even more, people will be sorted into mechanist roles - which means we'll lose even more people from other areas, where talent may be needed."
  robot_production_efficiency_3_tech: "Peak Efficiency"
  robot_production_efficiency_3_tech_desc: "Slowly, but surely, everybody from our nation will be sorted into our workshops and will construct more and more robots, just for our protection. Twelve-hour extended shifts, with replacements at the ready, with the keenest of our overseers - this is peak efficiency. What are some lives wasted next to an assembly line, if we can save lives being wasted on the battlefield?"

  main_scrap_robot: "Automatons"
  main_scrap_robot_desc: "The equivalent of industrial machinery given a simple propulsion system, two sub-caliber machineguns and a scrap metal shell covering sensitive parts, those \"scrap bots\" will still provide a tactical advantage in the form of an expendable shock trooper, an industrial-capacity reliant way to bolster our depleted divisions and an armored shield that our troops can take cover behind during assaults."

  protectron_robot: "Commercial Protectron"
  protectron_robot_desc: "Often called \"trashcans on legs\" for their cumbersome appearance and top-heavy design, civilian protectrons can still make useful shields for our main troops. Replacing the frail shell by a more sturdy armour steel one and supplying their recently added arm-mounted laser machine pistols with overcharged ammunition maximizes their potential in this role."

  protectron_2_robot: "Security Protectron"
  protectron_2_robot_desc: "Security Protectrons, or Mark 2 Protectrons, are a line of more advanced robots manufactured by Robco for light police duty. While \"advanced\" is a relative term when it comes to them, the addition of better housing for their arm-mounted laser weaponry, as well as switching their old laser pistols for cut-down laser sub-machinegun makes them fearsome opponents. The final touch is a series of bolted-on reinforced plating to supplement the bullet-proof shell."

# Robotics Armor
#-------------------------------
  robot_welded_rebar_tech: "Welded rebar"
  robot_welded_rebar_tech_desc: "The standard armor of robotics is too weak. We can weld rusty sheets of iron to it to increase the life of the robot on the battlefield."

  robot_harded_armor_tech: "Armor Hardening"
  robot_harded_armor_tech_desc: "Most commercially used robots were designed to be as light as possible, so their driving system can move them more easily, and through that, for a longer time. While the concept is noble, it isn't suited for our way of utilizing said units - we'll have to reinforce their thin and shiny aluminium composite with industrial-grade metal alloys."

  robot_impact_armor_tech: "Impact Resistant Armor"
  robot_impact_armor_tech_desc: "Made to withstand anything from melee combat to even anti-tank fire in some cases, our robotical units still suffer from some problems.

Attaching larger-sized batteries to our robots, will certainly improve their overall performance."
  
  robot_advance_power_system_tech: "Advanced Power Systems"
  robot_advance_power_system_tech_desc: "The main problem with the usual mechanical ally is that they're either bound to a local power source or have to operate through a rechargeable battery - neither of them very effective nor convenient. While replacing said technologies is out of bounds for us, we easily could replace our fission battery-based system with a mini nuclear reactor TX-28."

#-------------------------------
# Robotics Thruster
#-------------------------------
  robot_thruster_tech: "Thruster Engines"
  robot_thruster_tech_desc: "Thruster engines allowed pre-war robots to move easily over rough terrain, while also increasing their speed in contrast to bulky servo-driven predecessors. And while the complex system of counter-thrusters, gyroscope and main reactor device makes it more costly to produce than we would like, they will be very useful scout, flanking troops, and skirmishing divisions."

  robot_advance_thruster_tech: "Antigrav Engines"
  robot_advance_thruster_tech_desc: "Replacing chemical propulsion by an anti grav engine will let our divisions move on the battlefield without constant readjustements from their counter-thrusters, thus ensuring higher speed.

  robot_flamethrower_tech:0 "Flamethrower addon"
  robot_flamethrower_tech_desc:0 "The study of many removed flamethrower units provided our engineers with a better understanding of their main components, and even though it was prohibitive to arm our robots with such devices before, we can now upgrade them again with a better ones sporting a pressurized armored fuel cannister, and more harmful fuel composition designed around both direct damage and toxic byproducts."

 
  
  robot_alloy_tech:0 "Specialized Alloys"
  robot_alloy_tech_desc:0 "Our robots cannot mount as much weight as our vehicles, so we cannot armour them with the same alloy as effectively. A specialized material made to privilege weight savings and easy manufacturing over protection should reduce the strain on the servos, and allow us thicker and better shaped plating covering flaws in their armouring scheme."
  
  robot_cooling_systems_tech:0 "Cooling Systems"
  robot_cooling_systems_tech_desc:0 "The primary flaw with laser weaponry is the intense heat it emanates during firing procedure. By removing useless internal components around our robot's weapon mount, and installing a cooling jacket filled with oil, we can let our war machines fire much longer bursts and stay in the fight for hours before needing lense replacements."
  robot_cooling_systems_tech_2:0 "Advanced Cooling System"
  robot_cooling_systems_tech_2_desc:0 "More processing power and bigger internal reactors require more and more cooling to remain effective in the scorching desert heat of the wasteland.
