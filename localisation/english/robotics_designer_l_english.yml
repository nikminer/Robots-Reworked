    # Servo
      robots_primitive_servo: "Primitive servos"
      robots_primitive_servo_desc: "Primitive servos created in conditions of lack of resources and lack of necessary experience in the maintenance of robotic however, these servos allow robots to perform tasks in the absence of an alternative."
      robots_simple_servo: "Precision Motors"
      robots_simple_servo_desc: "Better internal assembly with improved internal gearing will make our robots able to react more precisely and efficiently to incoming threats.

      robots_welded_rebar: "Welded rebar"
      robots_welded_rebar_desc: "Rebar and other scrap metal are welded to the standard armor of the robot in the hope of reducing the damage received."
      robots_harded_plate: "Harded armor"
      robots_harded_plate_desc: "Reinforced armor attached to the frame of robot, allows you to better protect inner robotics system."
      robots_impact_resistance_plate: "Impact Resistant Armor"
      robots_impact_resistance_plate_desc: "The inner soft layer of Kevlar and synthetic foam around the subsystems provide cushioning, solve the problem of protecting the internal robotic system in battlefield."
    # Thruster
      robots_primitive_thruster: "Primitive Thruster"
      robots_primitive_thruster_desc: "Primitive thruster created in conditions of lack of resources and lack of necessary experience in the maintenance of robotic however, these thrusters allow robots to perform tasks in the absence of an alternative."
      robots_thruster: "Thruster Engines"
      robots_thruster_desc: "Thruster engines allowed pre-war robots to move easily over rough terrain, while also increasing their speed in contrast to bulky servo-driven predecessors."
      robots_advance_thruster: "Antigrav Engines"
      robots_advance_thruster_desc: "Replacing chemical propulsion by an anti grav engine will let our divisions move on the battlefield without constant readjustements from their counter-thrusters, thus ensuring higher speed."
    # Hardware
      robots_civilian_hardware: "Civilian Hardware"
      robots_civilian_hardware_desc: "A commercial system, common and cheap, is contained in most robots."
      robots_police_hardware: "Police Hardware"
      robots_police_hardware_desc: "Hardware embedded in police robots. It has a sufficiently effective performance for law enforcement."
      robots_military_hardware: "Military Hardware"
      robots_military_hardware_desc: "Hardware embedded in military robots. It has enough of the most effective performance for active warfare."
    # Software
      robots_civilian_operation_system: "Civilian OS"
      robots_civilian_operation_system_desc: "A commercial system designed for peaceful life, and has not the most effective algorithms for managing robot resources."
      robots_police_operation_system: "Police OS"
      robots_police_operation_system_desc: "The operating system created for police robots contains both basic state laws and strategies for dispersing rallies and demonstrations."
      robots_military_operation_system: "Military OS"
      robots_military_operation_system_desc: "The operating system created for military robots contains the basic tactics and strategies of combat."
     
      robots_mark1_operation_system: "Mark 1 OS"
      robots_mark1_operation_system_desc: "An operating system secretly developed by RobCo for robots of the Securitron family. This operating system has its drawbacks and does not allow securitrons to use the main weapon."

      robots_mark2_operation_system: "Mark 2 OS"
      robots_mark2_operation_system_desc: "An operating system secretly developed by RobCo for robots of the Securitron family. It contains improved combat programs and routines that allow you to turn an ordinary robot into a killer machine."
    
    # Special
      robots_cnp: "Command Navigational Program"
      robots_cnp_desc: "Software enhancement with the main goal to provide cross unit communication and coordination. Resulting in far higher efficiency in combat. So say we all."
      robots_cooling_systems: "Cooling Systems"
      robots_cooling_systems_desc: "The primary flaw with laser weaponry is the intense heat it emanates during firing procedure. By removing useless internal components around our robot's weapon mount, and installing a cooling jacket filled with oil, we can let our war machines fire much longer bursts and stay in the fight for hours before needing lense replacements."
      robots_high_power_optics: "High Power Optics"
      robots_high_power_optics_desc: "The regular optics used in robots at the most are designed to concentrate just enough light to perform their original task. While it is hardly enough for self-defence, it is utterly lacking the capabilities of any military application. Luckily, there are more than enough industrial- and army-grade grade optics to refit our mechanical soldiers."
      robots_organic_processor: "Organic Processors"
      robots_organic_processor_desc: "An organic processor is the most perfect of all possible processes, because it uses the human brain, thanks to which robots become more intelligent and distinguish their own from others more successfully."
      
      robots_extra_fuel_tank: "Fuel extra tank"
      robots_extra_fuel_tank_desc: "This component will be an excellent addition for any Mr Handy, this modification allows you to expand the fuel tank for the jet module, by getting rid of some parts of the body."
      robots_flamethrower: "Flamethrower addon"
      robots_flamethrower_desc: "This component will be an excellent addition for any Mr Handy, additional flamethrowers allow you to break through any enemy defense, although because of this, the robot will start consuming more jet fuel."
